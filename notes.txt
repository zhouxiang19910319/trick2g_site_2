Task I am trying to do:

1. retrieve youtube playlist JSON from its server
  `loadVids()`
2. append all the data to my HTML element

=========================================================
I've already set up the API key, playlist ID , URL, as well as options we need to submit when making HTTP request.


// Goal: Create a function that will load the main video.

function loadMainVideo(){
  // using fetch to make HTTP request
  // load the 1st video in the returned data into the main feed
}

function loadPlaylist(){
  // 0. find the exact data we need to tap into
  // 1. change data from object to array
  // 2. use forEach on this array
}




Goal: 

1. everytime I click on each item, the video ID of that item will be logged
2. 


background: 

1. I wrote a loadMainVideo function which will load the main video according to the videoId you pass in
2. in the second function loadPlaylist , it shall log the video ID everytime I click on the list item
3. the video ID the second function outputed , should be passed into the 1st function's videoID 





1. click thumbnail, log video ID of the thumbnail video.
2. click thumbnail , insert video ID of the thumbnail video into first_video_id in fetch function.
